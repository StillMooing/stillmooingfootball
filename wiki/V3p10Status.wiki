Version 3p10 release notes


= Details =

Done:

  * Everything (I believe) is working as it was last year.
    * Some minor changes had to be re-added (where'd I lose the changes) and things work brilliantly. 
  * ResetToWeek was added.  Currently it only reset to scratch, and then you can update week from there.
  * UserPicksByWeek was carried over from early season last year.
  * PicksByNFLTeam was added this year
    * Need further additions for full functionality.
  * Time seems to be calculated brilliantly now.
  * writeBlurb works fine from early last year
  * displayStandings works fine from early last year.  

TBD:

  * All the code needs to be thoroughly cleaned.
  * Other than that, really just site enhancements... She's getting pretty....
